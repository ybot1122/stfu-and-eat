## Instructions

1. Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).
2. In a bowl, combine ground meat, breadcrumbs, Parmesan, egg, garlic, salt, pepper, oregano, red pepper flakes (if using), and parsley. Mix until just combined—do not overwork.
3. Shape mixture into 12 meatballs (about 1½ tbsp each).
4. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Brown meatballs on all sides, about 6–8 minutes. They will finish cooking in the sauce.
5. Add marinara to the skillet (or transfer meatballs to a saucepan and pour sauce over). Simmer gently 10–12 minutes until cooked through.
6. Split rolls and place 3 meatballs in each. Spoon sauce over the meatballs and top with 2 slices cheese per sandwich.
7. Arrange assembled subs on a baking sheet and bake 5–7 minutes, until cheese is melted and rolls are lightly toasted. Alternatively, broil briefly—watch carefully.
8. Sprinkle with extra Parmesan and serve hot.
